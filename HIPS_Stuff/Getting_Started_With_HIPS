Log on to the computer using the ___ account with the password I provided in the lab info file. I have already downloaded all the necessary software to complete the HIPS generation. You can find Aladin on the left navigation bar on the computer home screen. The icon looks like _____. This application will allow you to view the files themselves or the index coverage of the whole grouping if you so choose. But, from what I could figure out, you are probably going to want to use the command line to finish the HIPS generation. For some reason the GUI has a tendency to throw errors at you and auto-abort the HIPS generation. I have been much more successful with the CLI version of Aladin. To access the command line, click the dark rectangle icon in the navigation bar. 

NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THE COMMAND LINE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. I'M JUST SAYING IT IS PROBABLY EASIER IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!!

Once you're in the command line interface, you will want to navigate to the directory where all the Aladin software is stored. The full directory path is _____. This location in your file tree is where you will want to be basing all of your HIPS work from. If you try to run the generation commands from elsewhere, the computer will not be able to find the software and nothing will happen. 

At this point in time, you will want to read up on the Aladin documentation to become familiar with the software and the necessary commands. For more on this you should navigate to the file called "Links" in this same directory. There, you can find the links to Aladin documentation which will guide you through the process of creating the HIPS directory. Originally it was my plan to try to write up a very basic walktrough for you so you didn't have to read all the documentation. But, to be frank, the people that work for Aladin are going to be able to explain their software better than I can. Plus it doesn't hurt to become familiar with the software from a more thorough source, even if some of it is redundant. This shouldn't require any technical background knowledge. You won't actually be running any code, just typing in commands and submitting them.
