When you get into the lab, there will be a desk against the left wall as soon as you walk in. The computer we use is connected to the monitor on the right side of that desk. There should also be a hard drive connected to that computer via a USB-C. This is the drive that contains all the files that will need to be used in the HIPS generation. There is a directory on this drive called "uncorrected_files", this is the files im referring to. Anything else on that drive can be ignored.
