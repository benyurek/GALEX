In case you forget, or if Erika hasn't given you all of this, below you will find information regarding access to the lab computer.


Location :            Steward Observatory Room 553A     (The door is to the right if you take the elevator to floor 5. It has a sign that says Hamden UV/Vis Detector Lab)

Door Code :           Since this is a public repo on google I think it's not safe for me to include it here but Erika can give it to you or you can email me. 

Computer Code :       Akgh2880                           (Case sensetive so make sure you use a capital A)


When you get into the lab, there will be a desk against the left wall behind the brown cabinets that you will see as soon as you walk in. The computer we use is connected to the monitor on the right side of that desk. There should also be a hard drive connected to that computer via a USB-C. This is the drive that contains all the files that will need to be used in the HIPS generation. To access the drive you can click on GalexDrive in the left side navigation bar once you're on the computer. There is a directory on this drive called "uncorrected_files", this is the files im referring to. Anything else on that drive can be ignored. MAKE SURE THAT YOU DONT DELETE ANY OF THESE FILES OR CORRUPT THE HARD DRIVE. EACH FILE IS ABOUT 6.2 GIGS SO THIS IS THE ONLY COPY OF THESE FILES THAT EXIST. SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM IT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY REALLY NOT GOOD.
