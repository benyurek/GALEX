To whoever takes over for the remainder of the project, 

Hello! My name is Ben Yurek and I was working on the technical side of this project for the last few months. I have created this repo so that you can see every file that has 
been used in the point source subtraction process. In case you ever need to reach me with any questions or explanations, email me at benjamin.yurek@gmail.com or ask Erika for
my number so you can text me. I'm less likely to see an email on my UA email, but you can also try benyurek@arizona.edu if all else fails. 

Anyway, to give a brief explanation, in the directory that this txt file resides in, you will also find comments and explanations for each of the code files that are used in
the point source subtraction process. If you have any background in CS you should be fine by just looking at the files directly. I'm simply including the extra info in case you
need any clarification when composing the final report. 

Additionally, there will be another directory that includes all the original code itself. I plan to name the comment files so that they match their corresponding code files. 
This way you should have no trouble keeping track of what does what. Try your best not to mess with any of the code if at all possible. I have spent a lot of time trying to 
figure out what works with our groups specific Arizona HPC group allocations and whatnot. Some of the code looks like it can be completed in a more simple way, but time and again 
I have thought the same thing just to run into a bug because HPC hates me. You have been warned. If you do change anything, do yourself a favor and make a copy of the original 
first in case something happens. 

Besides the code that I am providing in this repo, there is some more software that we have used called CloudClean. The link below this paragraph should take you to the GitHub 
that holds everything. I'm not sure how much of an explanation of that code Erika wants, but now you know where to find it if you need. Also if you dont want to have to come back
to this file you can just type "CloudClean Andrew Saydjari" in your browser. Hopefully you should never have to run any of the code you find in this github, besides the Aladin 
commands, so the technical setup when you first start should be very straightforward. With any luck, I should have everything set up on the lab computer so you never have to do 
anything on your own device. But, nobody is perfect so if there's something I overlooked, feel free to reach out via the contact i provided above and I'll do my best to help you
out.
