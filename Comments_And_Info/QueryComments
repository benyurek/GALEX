This Python script downloads and organizes GALEX telescope data from the MAST database. The script queries and downloads FUV imaging data for a specific sky coordinate, then organizes the files into a structured directory. It takes command-line arguments specifying a batch number, index, and sky coordinates, then uses the coord_query function to search the GALEX archive for FUV observations from four survey types. The download_dp function then downloads the matching FITS files from MAST, and the move_files function organizes everything by moving files from the nested mastDownload/GALEX/ directory structure to a simpler folder named according to the batch and coordinate information, unzipping all .fits.gz files to .fits format, and cleaning up empty directories.
