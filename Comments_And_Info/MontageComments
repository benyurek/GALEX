This Python script creates a large mosaic image from multiple GALEX observations by reprojecting and combining individual cleaned images into a single unified coordinate frame. The script takes command-line arguments for batch number, index, and sky coordinates to locate the processed data directory, then begins by cleaning the edges of the statistical draw files produced by the Julia inpainting algorithm. For each draw file, it applies edge cleaning to remove artifacts and updates the FITS header using information from the corresponding intensity file, saving these cleaned versions in a new "raw" subdirectory. The script then uses the MontagePy toolkit to perform astronomical image mosaicking, first defining the output mosaic parameters including the central coordinates and the GALEX dataset identifier. The mosaicking process proceeds through several stages: creating a FITS header that defines the output coordinate system and image dimensions using mHdr, generating a metadata table of all input images in the raw directory with mImgtbl, reprojecting each individual image to match the output coordinate frame using mProjExec which transforms images from their native orientations to a common projection, creating another metadata table for the reprojected images, and finally combining all reprojected images into a single mosaic using mAdd with the coadd parameter set to 0 to produce an uncorrected mosaic without background matching. This uncorrected mosaic serves as an intermediate product that illustrates the need for background correction between images, though the script as written stops at this stage without performing the actual background correction. The entire process utilizes multiprocessing capabilities as indicated by the SLURM CPU allocation, allowing efficient handling of the numerous image reprojection and combination operations required to create the final mosaic.
